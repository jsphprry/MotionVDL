	Application development for CI536 Integrated group project

# 1.1 Introduction
# ----------------
	
	Motion Video Data Labeller is a tool for producing labelled
	datasets from video data for use in supervised machine learning.

# 1.2 Potentional applications of the labelled data
# -------------------------------------------------
	
	The functionality of MotionVDL could be extended with 
	a helper vision system that could help identify poorly 
	labelled frame data.
	
	Label sequences could be used to train LSTM models and 
	labelled frames could be used to train conditional GANs.
	
	LSTM-GANs could be used to model the label sequences and 
	produce generated sequences that could then be used to 
	train an image generating GAN to produce new video data 
	that is visually similar to the original data.
